### CIFAR10_Image_Classification_ANN_vs_CNN
  * Comparison of simple ANN and CNN models on CIFAR10 dataset
  
  * STEPS.....
  1. Importing libraries
  2. Loading dataset
  3. Testing the sizes of the samples
  4. Visualizing first 5 images
  5. Normalization of features and 2D->1D change for labels
  6. Simple ANN model training
  7. This simple ANN model evaluation criteria in a classification report
  8. Simple CNN model training
  9. This simple CNN model evaluation criteria in a classification report
  10. Comparison between ANN and CNN model
  
  * Results
    - CNN model training time is faster than ANN model training time
    - CNN model parameters(167,562) are lower than ANN model parameters(17,232,010)
    - CNN model accuracy is higher than the ANN model
